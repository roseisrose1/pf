# What is network cabling?

Network cables are used to connect and transfer data and information between computers, routers, switches and storage area networks . These cables are essentially the carrier or media through which data flows.

There are different types of communications cables, and the appropriate type to use will depend on the structure and topology of the overall architecture of the system. The most commonly used types of communications cables are dominated by what is referred to as “twisted pair cable”. In local area networks; typically office environments, retail and commmercial sites, copper commincations cabling, i.e.,twisted pair cable is by far the most commonly used type of cable.

Twisted pair cable is used in many ethernet networks. Comprising of four pairs of thin wires or conductors, these ‘wires’ or conductors, are contained inside of the insulation or outer sheath of the cable. Each pair is twisted into several additional twists. These twists are designed to prevent interference from other devices and indeed from other adjacent cables!

Fibre optic cabling is specified where high bandwidths may be needed; especially in the data centre environment and where an installation demands high capacity, typically a hospital, airports, banks….However, Fibre optic cabling is fast becoming the medium of choice for any installation that is sending high volumes of data!

Of course, there are other types of cables, i.e., coaxial cable, multipair cable and of course, other types of media such as wireless, otherwise known as wifi.

# Switches

Switches are key building blocks for any network. They connect multiple devices, such as computers, wireless access points, printers, and servers; on the same network within a building or campus. A switch enables connected devices to share information and talk to each other.

# Unmanaged switches

An unmanaged network switch is designed so that you can simply plug them in and they work, no configuration required. Unmanaged switches are typically for basic connectivity. You'll often see them used in home networks or wherever a few more ports are needed, such as at your desk, in a lab, or in a conference room.

# Managed switches

Managed switches give you greater security and more features and flexibility because you can configure them to custom-fit your network. With this greater control, you can better protect your network and improve the quality of service for those who access the network.

# Network hubs and switches

A network hub is a central connection point for devices in a local area network, or LAN. But there's a limit to the amount of bandwidth users can share on a hub-based network. The more devices are added to the network hub, the longer it takes data to reach its destination. A switch avoids these and other limitations of network hubs.
A large network may include multiple switches, which connect different groups of computer systems together. These switches are typically connected to a router that allows connected devices to access the Internet.

# What is a router and how does it work in a network?
 While switches allow different devices on a network to communicate, routers allow different networks to communicate.
A router is a networking device that routes data packets between computer networks. A router can connect networked computers to the Internet, so multiple users can share a connection. Routers help connect networks within an organization or connect the networks of multiple branch locations. And a router works as a dispatcher. It directs data traffic, choosing the best route for information to travel across the network, so that it's transmitted as efficiently as possible.
